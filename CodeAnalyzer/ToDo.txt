ToDo
======================
- add checkbox for metric error display-1
- use newly added ASTNode member parentType_ to simplify ActionsAndRules handlers and GrammarHelper
- add start button to display mode view in GUI
- display package name only once in public data display
- for folding needs to be strengthed - see IRule::doActions - fold recursively
- add function for global data display
- add mechanism to optionally seach specified directory instead of recursing
- select directories to skip - deposit empty file SkipCodeAnalysis and check while running
- strengthen C++ function rule for Lambda detection
- strengthen type lookup to account for namespace qualification
  -- make Type Table that holds type name, list of namespaces, file where defined
- look for refactorings, especially common code extraction to functions
- refactor large functions in Window views
