General Build Instructions
==========================
1. To build a project as a static library:
   a. Project > Properties > General > Project Defaults > Configuration Type > Static Library
   b. Project > Properties > C/C++ > Preprocessor > Preprocessor Definitions > noTEST_PROJECTNAME;
   c. Right-Click on Project and select Build
2. To build project as an application (.exe)
   a. Project > Properties > General > Project Defaults > Configuration Type > Application (.exe)
   b. Project > Properties > C/C++ > Preprocessor > Preprocessor Definitions > TEST_PROJECTNAME;
   c. Right-Click on Project and select Build

Required References (all references must be built as static libraries)
======================================================================
1. DbCore needs reference to DateTime
2. Edit needs reference to DateTime
3. Executive needs reference to XmlDocument
4. PayLoad needs reference to XmlDocument
5. Persist needs references to DateTime and XmlDocument
6. Query needs references to DateTime and XmlDocument
7. TestApplication needs reference to Executive
8. TestClassProj needs references to DateTime and XmlDocument

Build Instructions for TestClassProj
====================================
TestClassProj demonstrates that NoSqlDb meets its requirements
1. Set DateTime to build as static library
2. Set XmlDocument to build as static library
3. Right-Click on TestClassProject and select Set as Startup Project
4. Set TestClassProj to build as executable
   a. Right-Click on references > Add References > add DateTime and XmlDocument
   a. TestClassProj > Properties > General > Project Defaults > Configuration Type > Application (.exe)
   b. Right-Click on TestClassProj and select Build

Build Instructions for TestApplication
=======================================
TestApplication demonstrates how client code uses NoSqlDb
1. Right-Click on TestApplication and select Set as StartUp Project
2. Set Executive to build as static library
3. Set TestApplication to build as an application (.exe)
   a. Right-Click on references > Add References > add Executive
   b. Right-Click on TestApplication and select Build

Build Instructions for Executive
================================
Executive builds NoSqlDb library for deployment
1. Set Executive to build as static library
   a. Right-Click on references > Add References > add XmlDocument
   b. Right-Click on Executive and select Build

Build Instructions for Solutions that use NoSqlDb
=================================================
To use NoSqlDb in other solutions: 
1. Copy the entire NoSqlDb directory tree into the using project solution folder
2. You don't need to add any of the individual project files into the using projects.
3. Just include the NoSqlDb.h file and the applcation's PayLoad.h file.
4. Link to the Executive.lib file by making a reference to the Executive project

Build Instructions for DateTime as standalone executable
========================================================
1. Right-Click on DateTime and select Set as StartUp Project
2. Set DateTime to build as executable
   a. DateTime > Properties > General > Project Defaults > Configuration Type > Application (.exe)
   b. DateTime > Properties > C/C++ > Preprocessor > Preprocessor Definitions > TEST_DATETIME;
3. Right-Click on DateTime and select Build

Build Instructions for TestUtilities as standalone executable
=============================================================
1. Note that All of the Utilities in the solution's Utilities folder provide all their functionality
   via their header files.
2. For that reason Projects that use them don't have to build them, but simply include their header files.
3. Right-Click on TestUtilities and select Set as StartUp Project
4. TestUtilities > Properties > C/C++ > Preprocessor > Preprocessor Definitions > TEST_TESTUTILITIES;
5. Right-Click on TestUtilities and select Build

Build Instructions for StringUtilities as standalone executable
=============================================================
1. Note that All of the Utilities in the solution's Utilities folder provide all their functionality
   via their header files.
2. For that reason Projects that use them don't have to build them, but simply include their header files.
3. Right-Click on StringUtilities and select Set as StartUp Project
4. StringUtilities > Properties > C/C++ > Preprocessor > Preprocessor Definitions > TEST_STRINGUTILITIES;
5. Right-Click on StringUtilities and select Build
